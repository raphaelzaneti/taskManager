# taskManager
My first web project and my Hello World on GitHub. In a first moment, this project just includes some HTML, CSS and JavaScript Vanilla! The design is not the best, but soon I must work on it.

I hope you enjoy it! :)

### What is this project?
A simple task manager with CRUD features. Everything is running on frontend, as I still studying about the backend. In a future version, I expect to improve this project to be a fullstack application.

### What does the project looks like?
Here goes a loom video about the application inteface:

### What was your motivation?
As a first project, I just followed the suggestions of tech influencers, creating an application with CRUD features. On the first version of the project, I had no knowledge about some very useful tools to web development, as React or some libs. In future, I intend to refatorate all of this project, adjusting the logics and the design.

### Why did I build this project?
My goal was practice the basics of web development.

### What problem does it solve?
The project help people to oganize it's tasks on an lists view.

### What did I learn?
Until now (Sep 25, 2021), I learned the basics of DOM intereaction and how JavaScript can create, edit and remove HTML elements. 

### Future plans
To the next months, I intend to:
1. Adjust the design of application, changing the main colors and structure;
2. Add Bootstrap components;
3. Improve the CSS, working with responsive solutions;
4. Start a backend structure;
5. Work on the constant improving of the application!
